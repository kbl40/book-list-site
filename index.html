				<h3>All the cliche sayings are true about it...</h3>
				<p>Reading takes you across the world or throughout the universe, it expands your mind, it makes you see things from different perspectives, it can make you more introspective, it makes you smarter....blah, blah, blah. There's a nugget of truth to all of those things. Embrace whichever one works for you, lean into it and read as often and diversly as you can.</p>

						<p>This is probably my top fiction book I've read. It's a tale that keeps you engaged by trying to decipher the mystery the protagonist is going though. Read with a group, assemble, and discuss. Be prepared to be surprised with others' interpretations of what Kafka meant by the trail.</p>
